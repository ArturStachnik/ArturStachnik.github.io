                <p>Hello, I'm Artur Stachnik, a PhD Candidate and Researcher at Complutense University of Madrid. My journey in science is driven by a deep passion for merging new advancements in Computer Science with climate studies. Currently, my research focuses on analyzing climate patterns from the past, present, and future using cave and lake systems as proxies. Through Python-based modeling, I aim to uncover insights that are crucial for understanding and addressing environmental changes.</p>
                <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a profound love for meteorology. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the weather, always eager to understand the forces that shape our world. This passion has naturally led me to a career where I can explore and contribute to this field in meaningful ways.</p>
                <p>In addition to my professional interests, I am also a dedicated speleologist. For the past ten years, I’ve been exploring the hidden wonders of caves, a tradition that runs deep in my family. Speleology has taught me patience, resilience, and the beauty of the unknown, all of which enrich my perspective as a researcher.</p>
                <p>Combining my scientific endeavors with my love for the natural world, I strive to make a positive impact on our understanding of climate and weather, hoping to contribute to a better future for our planet.</p>
